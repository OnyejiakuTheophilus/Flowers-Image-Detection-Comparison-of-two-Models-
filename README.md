# Flowers-Image-Detection-Comparison-of-two-Models-
This is project on Deep learning involving the Image detection of 5 classes of Flowers.  We used two models: a large and small neural networks, and compared their accuracy as well their loss curves. At the end of the day, the Large neural network performed better than the small neural network.
